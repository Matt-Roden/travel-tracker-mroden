### Contributors:

## Objectives

- Build an application that allows a user to track their adventures in traveling as well as request new trips from the agency. This means that a user can login, see all of their previous, upcoming, current, and pending trips as well as request a new trip, which would then need to be accepted by the agency. All of the data from this application is coming from a local API. This project utilizes the `fetchAPI` and currently uses the `GET` and `POST` methods.  

## Technology Stack

`JavaScript` `HTML` `SCSS` `Mocha` `Chai` `WebPack` `Git` `GitHub` `fetchAPI` `dayjs`

## Setup

1. Clone the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
2. clone down this local API repo, [apiRepo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api/tree/main/data) in any directory
3. Run `npm start` in the terminal insdie of the main project repo and in your bwoser copy in the following link `http://localhost:8080/`
4. Navigate to the local API repo directory and run `npm start`

## Achievements
- Writing an application from scratch
- Successfully implementing the `fetchAPI` using `GET` to receive data and `POST` to post data to the server
- Making a login page and using logic to decide if the credentials are correct.
- Adding phone, tablet, and desktop responsiveness

## Future Iterations
- Add the agency class to manage user trips and deicde to accept or deny pending requests
- Go deeper into SCSS and the styling (this is something I really enjoy doing but I wanted to challenge myself and focus on the JS)
- Create a more sufficient and appealing layout
- Complete all missing functionalities
